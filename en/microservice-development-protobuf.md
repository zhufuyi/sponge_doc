`‚ì∏Create grpc service based on protobuf` create generic web service code, you can choose your own database and orm. while `‚ì∂Create grpc service based on sql` (a.k.a. <a href="/microservice-development-mysql" target="_blank">GRPC service development (sql)</a>) only supports mysql, postgresql, tidb, sqlite database types, which is one of the main differences between the two ways of creating web services, and you can think of `‚ì∂Create grpc service based on sql` as a subset of `‚ì∏Create grpc service based on protobuf`.

`‚ì∏Create grpc service based on protobuf`, if you choose other database types (not supported by sponge), you need to manually write code for dao, model, database initialisation, etc. code, which does not support auto-generation; if you choose data supported by sponge, you can automatically generate dao, model, database initialisation, etc. code.

Therefore, `‚ì∏Create grpc service based on protobuf` is suitable for generic grpc service project development.

## üè∑Using MySQL for GRPC Service Development

### üîπPre-development Preparations

Before developing a grpc service project, make sure you have:

- sponge installed
- MySQL service
- MySQL tables
- Proto files, for example, [user.proto](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge_examples/blob/main/2_web-gin-protobuf/api/user/v1/user.proto).

> [!tip] Generating service CRUD code requires a MySQL service and MySQL tables. If you don't have them ready, here is a [script to start a MySQL service using Docker](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge/blob/main/test/server/mysql/docker-compose.yaml). After starting the MySQL service, import the SQL script for the [sample database and table](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge_examples/blob/main/1_web-gin-CRUD/test/sql/user.sql).

Open a terminal and start the sponge UI service:

```bash
sponge run
```

Access the sponge code generation UI by navigating to http://localhost:24631 in your web browser.

<br>

### üîπCreating a GRPC Service Project

In the sponge UI interface:

1. click on the left-hand menu `Protobuf` --> `Create grpc service`.
2. Select the proto file(s) (multiple selections are possible).
3. Fill in the other parameters, and hover over the question mark `?` to view parameter descriptions.

After completing the parameters, click the `Download Code` button to generate the grpc service project code, as shown in the image below:

![micro-rpc-pb](assets/images/micro-rpc-pb.png)

> [!tip] Equivalent command: **sponge micro rpc-pb --module-name=user --server-name=user --project-name=edusys --protobuf-file=./user.proto**

> [!tip] The generated code directory name format is `ServiceName-Type-Date`. You can modify the directory name (e.g., remove the type and date) if desired.

> [!tip] After successfully generating the code, sponge saves the record for future use. It displays the previously used parameters when you refresh or reopen the page.

Here is the created microservices code directory structure:

```

‚îú‚îÄ api
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ types
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ user

```

The egg model for the created grpc service code structure:

![micro-rpc-pb-anatomy](assets/images/micro-rpc-pb-anatomy.png)

Unzip the code files, open a terminal, switch to the grpc service code directory, and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Generate and merge API-related code
make proto

# Compile and run the service
make run
```

> [!note] During development, you will frequently use the `make proto` command, which internally runs a series of code generation subcommands: it generates template code for API interfaces, error codes, grpc client testing code, and relevant *.pb.go files. It also automatically merges the API-related code. You don't need to worry about overwriting existing business logic code. Even if something unexpected happens (e.g., a power outage), you can find a backup of the code before each merge in the `/tmp/sponge_merge_backup_code` directory. If you are on a Windows environment, it will be located at `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Temp\sponge_merge_backup_code`. If you add or update API interface descriptions in the proto files, you need to execute this command; otherwise, it's not necessary.

Use the **Goland** IDE to open the project code, navigate to the `internal/service` directory, and open the test file with the suffix `_client_test.go`. This file contains tests and performance benchmarking functions for each API interface defined in the proto file. You can fill in request parameters before testing, similar to testing API interfaces in a Swagger interface, as shown below:

![micro-rpc-test](assets/images/micro-rpc-test.png)

If you don't have the **Goland** IDE, you can run tests using commands. Switch to the `internal/service` directory, open the test file with the suffix `_client_test.go`, modify the request parameters for the grpc methods, and execute the test command, e.g., `go test -run Test_service_teacher_methods/GetByID`.

### üîπAutomatically Adding CRUD API Interfaces

Automatically adding CRUD API interfaces is the same as described in the "GRPC service development (sql)" section in the document. You can click to view the documentation on <a href="/microservice-development-mysql?id=%f0%9f%8f%b7automatically-adding-crud-api-interfaces" target="_blank">Automatically Adding CRUD API Interfaces</a>.

> [!tip] In the CRUD API interfaces, there is a paginated query interface with arbitrary conditions. With this interface, you can avoid writing many API query interfaces.

## üè∑Developing GRPC Service with Other Databases

`‚ì∏Create grpc service based on protobuf` do not include database-related code by default. you can choose any database type as a data store, the above describes the choice of mysql (sponge support for database types mysql, postgresql, tidb, sqlite) for the specific process of web development, the operation is simple and convenient.

Although sponge doesn't support automatically generating database-related code for other database types, it generates API interface template code, grpc client test code, error codes, and automates the merging of template code. This significantly reduces the need for manual code writing, making grpc service development simpler and more convenient compared to traditional grpc service development.

The process for developing grpc service with other database types is mostly the same as the one for MySQL, with the main difference being in the database operation-related code, which needs to be manually written.

<br>

### üîπPre-development Preparations

Before developing a grpc service project:

- Ensure that sponge is installed.
- Have a database service running.
- Prepare proto files, e.g., [user.proto](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge_examples/blob/main/2_web-gin-protobuf/api/user/v1/user.proto).

Open your terminal and start the sponge UI by running:

```bash
sponge run
```

Please refer to the section above on <a href="/microservice-development-protobuf?id=%f0%9f%94%b9creating-a-grpc-service-project" target="_blank">Creating a GRPC Service Project</a>.

<br>

### üîπInitializing the Database

**(1) Adding Database Configuration**

Open the configuration file `configs/service-name.yml` and add the data address configuration. For example:

```yml
# elasticsearch settings
elasticsearch:
 addr: "http://localhost:9200"
```

In your terminal, navigate to the service directory and execute the following command to update the configuration Go structure:

```bash
make update-config
```

<br>

**(2) Adding Initialization Code for Data**

Create a new file `init.go` in the `internal/model` directory and add the code for connecting to the database. You can refer to the [MySQL initialization example](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge/blob/main/internal/model/init.go).

Next, go to the `cmd/service-name/initial` directory and open `initApp.go`. Replace the default comments with MySQL and cache initialization code. Also, open `registerClose.go` and replace the default comments with MySQL and cache connection closing code.

<br>

### üîπAdding Custom API Interfaces

> [!note] When writing business logic code in api interface template code, if it involves manipulating data, you need to manually write `model`, `dao` and other code.

Adding custom API interfaces is the same as described in the "Custom API interfaces" section of the document under "GRPC service development (sql)". You can click to view the documentation on <a href="/microservice-development-mysql?id=%f0%9f%94%b9generating-and-using-cache-code" target="_blank">Generating and Using Cache Code</a> instructions.

> [!tip] In manually added custom API interfaces, you may need to use caching, such as generating tokens. For string-type cache code like this, you can generate it directly and don't need to write it manually.
